            I love to create.  I am equally passionate about sharing my dishes with people for their
            utmost enjoyment.  That passion is what lit my fire to create my own pasta sauce.  What started
            as a desire to create my own sauce to fulfill my personal palate turned into a journey of
            sharing with friends, family and then the public.  I brought my pasta sauce to work for a
            "potluck."  We did this often, and once I brought my sauce, I no longer needed to sign up
            for a dish as one or many of my coworkers would sign up for me with a demand for my sauce.
            They were then requesting me to make sauce for them for them to purchase.  With my
            entrepreneurial spirit, I fulfilled on their request and took it a step(or many) further and
            educated myself on "canning."  I then began making large quantities and filling mason jars,
            even made cute little labels to make the jars look fancy or legit.  I would bring in a case
            to work and would sell out in minutes.  Back to the kitchen I went, and this continued on for
            a period of time until I decided to participate in a craft show.  Making huge amounts of
            product, I sold it ALL and had to take orders and had people coming to pick up product from
            me or I would deliver cases.  I did this for a while, working the "craft show circuit" and
            then I took it even further and decided to mass produce.  I worked several farmers markets
            and worked my way into some small specialty stores.

                I continued to grow, and partnered
                with a distribution company and currently have my "ChefMel's Sweet Sicilian Style Pasta Sauce"
                available at the 2 largest grocery chains in St. Louis, along with a few specialty stores,
                over 100 locations in MO and IL in total.
